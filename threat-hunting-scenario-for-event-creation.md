# üîç Threat Hunt: Unauthorized RDP Access

## üìå Event Summary
**Remote Desktop Connection from Unapproved External IP Address**

---

## üéØ Hunt Justification

Security Operations detected multiple successful Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logins to internal systems originating from **non-corporate IP addresses**. Some of these logins came from geolocations inconsistent with employee travel records. 

In response to a recent **CISA advisory on brute-force RDP attacks**, management has directed a proactive threat hunt to identify signs of RDP misuse or unauthorized access.

## üß± Steps Taken by the Threat Actor (Based on Logs and IoCs)

1. **Obtained valid employee credentials**  
   _Possible methods:_ phishing, password spraying, or credential leaks (e.g., via dark web).

2. **Initiated RDP session**  
   From an external IP address, often using residential VPNs or proxies to mask location.

3. **Successfully logged into a corporate workstation or server**

4. **Executed reconnaissance commands**  
   Tools used: `Task Manager`, `PowerShell`, or `cmd.exe` to enumerate processes, privileges, and files.

5. **Transferred files using shared folders or clipboard**  
   Examples: `mimikatz.exe`, `winPE.zip`, `anydesk.exe`

6. **Performed lateral movement**  
   Leveraged built-in Windows tools to access other systems.
